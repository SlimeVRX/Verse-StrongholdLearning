Transcript:
(00:00) what out what up when Bush here and today we're going to make a game mode called stronghold now this is a cool mode where you can have a team go in and infiltrate a stronghold now the team will be able to go in either stealth or just go through guns blazing we're going to have some cool systems set up like have ai guards enemy detection have them Garden like certain paths all the cool things that make it really engaging game so sit back relax and let's jump right into it now epic games just put out a template in which we're going to be
(00:27) following the documentation so if you want to follow along make sure you look down in the comments down below where I'll leave a link because I'm going to be following this guide because it has some versus code in there that we can actually copy and paste in our game level so we don't have to do any custom programming at all and so in order to get started we're inside of uefn we want to make sure we're on a blank project here and we're just going to click create now once you have your blank project in here and the first thing I
(00:51) want to do is over here instead of my outliner I'm going to go to Island settings and we're going to switch some of these out so for voice chat we're going to leave it on team and day for max players I'm just going to do a team of four that's what's suggested but you can have as many in there as you want and then coming down here to where it says teams instead of free for all this is not a battle royale we want to do Cooperative so they could go through and infiltrate this Palace together now for team size we're going to make it four
(01:17) and then we're going to skip all these and we're going to look for some spawning stuff down here so let me scroll down to where it says spawn pad selection and instead of random we want to do their teammates because we want the teammates to infiltrate the palettes together not be spread out all over the map and then we're going to scroll down again to where we can see auto start which will be right here so I'm going to turn this off but then for game start countdown we're going to make this three so when we made the auto start false
(01:43) we're telling the countdown we want to have a countdown at the top so the game just doesn't start we actually have a little countdown timer at the beginning to get everybody acclimated and ready to go and then we're going to scroll down and we're going to look for Harvest style which would be under user options game settings here until we see it right here so as we say before it's not a battle royale we're going to put this in creative mode and then for a lab building we probably want to put it on none you can if you want to but in my
(02:09) game I don't want them building anything I want them going along with the map I create and then building can destroy environment I'm going to click this on false and environment damage I'm going to put this on off structural damage also put this on none because we don't want them to be able to destroy any of the environment or any of the buildings in there and not think we're set for that so now let's go down and look for some respawning tags here in which respawn time we're going to put this up to five and then we're going to
(02:37) come down and let's look for jump fatigue which we want to put this on now you can have this off if you want but I don't want the characters to just be able to keep jumping we want to put fatigue on there just to make the battles a little bit more interesting but we're going to scroll down and look for some glider settings so glider redeploy we want to check this on for true and then for our flight speed instead of three we want to have it on one just in case you start maybe your map may be on top of like a tall
(03:02) structure you want them to kind of Glide in but you don't want them to fly across the map we're going to put this down to one just to slow them down a little bit and now let's come under the game settings for like when the characters actually win so we're going to keep scrolling down it's going to be under the ey settings in which timer Direction I'm going to leave it on countdown one for game winner display time I'm actually going to leave this up for three seconds but for the scoreboard let's put this up for 15. same thing for
(03:28) when they win around we'll keep that up for three seconds and then the round display score put this on 15. now we want to have some stuff display inside the HUD so we're going to come down here look for the HUD info type and now we're going to turn on the HUD info type and we're just going to leave it turned on for AI enemy elimination then we're going to scroll down look for a map screen map screen display which we have here instead of scoreboard we're going to do overview map and then we're going to come down here to where it says game
(03:56) and call outs instead of win lose because we're on a team we're going to do cooperative and then the last thing we're going to select right here is the victory sound now we have a whole plethora of different options here I'm just going to do success one but for defeat sound and draw sound I'm just going to leave this on the default but feel free to change this to anything you want now all these options are actually inside the official documentation so again I'm going to leave the link down below make sure you click on that
(04:22) because if I went too fast you can always have this reference that you could go back to and now we're going to go on to section two where we're going to set up some verse coding for our leash so if you look at the map that epic actually put inside the documentation this is an example of how everything's going to be working with the AI guards but let's set up everything for our coding inside of verse now what we want to look for now is the verse Explorer which would be over here actually let me move over my details panel and I'm going
(04:48) to drag out the verse Explorer so we can see it a little bit better now if you don't see this tab all you have to do is come up here to the top where it says verse and their tools and you would click on versus Explorer and that will bring this up for us now you'll notice right here this is the actual name of our game level that we created when we started off our tutorial here so what you want to do is right click on this whatever you named it and add new verse file to project and once you have create verse script upright here it's going to
(05:15) say device name hello world device in which I'm going to delete this and we're going to name this one stronghold underscore game underscore manager just like that and then down here at the bottom I'm going to hit create empty and now you see under content we have a green plus symbol and it has the verse that we just created so now I'm just going to double click on this now if this is your first time doing anything with coding on your computer it's going to ask you to install the visual studio code in which again you're going to need
(05:47) this to be able to code anything reverse so I would suggest that you install it like so so you would just go over and you're going to click on yes here and then it's going to pop up with this installation guide right here which everything is pretty straightforward just accept the agreement hit next and then you're just going to want to install it I'm just going to leave it on default hit next again and then right here I'm just going to leave everything at default and once you're done installing everything this is what
(06:12) should pop up here now this is where we're going to do the versus code in which epic just applied for us so if I go to the official documentation I want to make sure I'm over here set up leash devices under stronghold template and this is going to be the verse code that we have so I'm just going to actually just select everything in here make sure you have everything selected and I'm just going to copy it and then back in visual code Studio I'm actually just going to delete this I'm going to hit Ctrl V and I'm just going
(06:43) to paste it in there now I'm going to come over to file I'm going to click on Save and I'm just going to exit this out and then after you do that you're going to come up here to verse with this still selected and we're going to build the verse code so now with that built out let me actually move this over here a little bit I'm going to come down here to the content drawer and I'm going to come down here look for Creative devices and now you should see right here where it says stronghold at least position now
(07:08) we're just going to left click and drag it into our viewport and now you just officially built out your first release device so now that we have our leash device in there to hold to position we also want to copy and paste it to make one for fallback as well so inside of my viewport I'm actually going to select this let's move it back a little bit we don't want to have it quite so close to our spawn points right there so let's move it out there a little bit and then come back to my outliner double click on it just to zoom it in and then I'm going
(07:35) to scroll back a little bit I'm going to hold down the ALT key on my keyboard I'm going to left click and just drag it over and now we made a duplicate of it so I'm going to go back to my outliner now and instead of this one called stronghold lease position I'm going to actually click on this I'm going to name this one fall back so this is where AI is going to know to fall back to so we can't even have it back here a little bit so this is the position that they want to hold and this is where they're going to fall back to
(08:03) once the AI realizes it's getting overrent now I'm going to select both of these like so so I just held down the shift key I have both of these selected I'm gonna go back to my details panel and right here where it says visible in game I'm actually going to make this false because we don't want to be able to see these once we're inside the game now let's get to the fun part and set up some enemy AIS which is going to guard the stronghold so back inside of uefn I'm going to come down here to my content drawer I'm going
(08:32) to select all and actually let me dock this in my panel here sit down here I want to come to my search bar and I'm just going to type in guard like so and I'm just going to drag and drop it here into my scene and just set it down somewhere like so and now let's say we're going to start off with the snipers right so maybe you want to have them a little bit further back and maybe even let's bring in the shape for them to stand on so I'm just going to bring in maybe just like a cube and the cool thing is let me select my guard right
(09:01) here under location I could just right click copy and then select my cube right click paste and now it's going to put it into that position so if I come over double click on my Cube now we're front and center with our Cube here so let's make this a little bit longer come back to my details panel actually let me put this over to the side again so we can see both at once something like that so I'm not clicking back and forth except for my scale let's make this Cube something large maybe like five drag this up a little bit
(09:32) because these are snipers then I'm going to come over here inside of my outliner look for my guard spawner select this drag it up like so somewhere around there and then instead of guard spawner I'm just going to name this one gar spawner Sniper Tower like so so guard spawner Sniper Tower that's what this one's going to be called right here and I'm actually going to select both of these so let me select my Cube and my spawner I'm going to hold down the ALT key left click and drag because I want to have two snipers in here one
(10:07) on each side so maybe let's drag this to the complete opposite side somewhere over there so now we have two snipers inside of our map so let me actually before I do anything I'm going to double click on my guard here just move in a little bit so we can see a little bit better what's happening inside of my outliner I'm just going to select both of these so I'm doing it to both snipers at the Sim is that time so to get started off inside the attributes panel for guard type I'm just going to leave it as Shadow but you
(10:34) can see how you have different selections in here how you can select these different types but for this one I'm going to make it the Shadow and for spawn count I'm actually going to make it one so we have one sniper per spawn point here let me drag this over a little bit more so we can read this a little bit better so spawn on patrol Point path group I'm Gonna Leave This one at zero for now because I'm not going to have it go in the path we're going to get into that a little bit later but for my item list I'm actually
(11:01) going to left click on this drag this down and then we're going to look for our gun so with this selected right here under none I'm going to type in rail that's going to bring up these railguns something like that but it's up to you what you want to have have your snipers have up there so we have them with the railgun right now and we don't want to allow the infinite spawn because once they're gone we want to make sure that they're gone so we're going to leave that with a total spawn limit of just one because once they come into the map
(11:26) and once you take them out then they're completely gone and we don't want them to come back after us now for the guard tape option I'm going to leave it on team index and Guard team index I'm going to leave this at Team index and I'm actually going to make this one too so there's going to be two teams in here basically it's going to be the guards versus the general public which would be the players and so if you wanted to have multiple teams in here you could count the number up but basically like if you have three then that means that the AI
(11:54) might fight amongst themselves depending on what team number they have on so what I'm going to do for stronghold is all the guards are going to be on team too and then all the players are going to be on team one and then we're going to leave on spawn on timer but for the timer we're going to have it at zero because we want them to come in instantly and then show spawn radius we can actually turn this off but actually let me leave this on for right now just so we can see what's going to happen right here with the radius so instead of
(12:18) 10 I'm going to put this at like 2.5 because we want them to stay just on the guard Tower here and now I could turn this off so we don't see it anymore and this right here play spawn visual effect you can leave it on if you want I'm gonna turn it off just because when the character is coming to the game maybe we won't have the snipers beheading and we don't want to see any visual effects revealing where they are so starting health I'm going to leave it at 100 Max Health 100 I'm not going to have them with any Shields though but feel free to
(12:45) give them shows if you want to you have those two settings right here for Max shield and starting shield but I'm going to show the health bar just so the player knows how much energy is left on the character then let's go down look for a visibility range which is right here since they're snipers maybe make it a little bit longer so we're going to have it about 70.
(13:04) and then we're going to look for a drop inventory on elimination I'm actually going to turn this off again this is going to be custom to how you want your gameplay so if you want them to drop the railgun when they get taking out feel free to do so but I'm going to leave the players with the weapons that we select from at the beginning and then right here for accuracy also this is something that's going to pertain to how you want it to be but I'm going to put it at very high because these are snipers so now that we have our snipers all set and ready to go
(13:28) now we're going to put some foot soldiers on the ground that are going to patrol the area for us now you could go back to the content drawer and search for an enemy spawner again or you could just select the sniper that we just made make sure you hold down the ALT key left click and drag to make a duplicate and then I'm just going to put this one on the ground so let's say somewhere around here let's drag them for it a little bit have them set up around the stronghold areas somewhere around here so let's put him a little bit closer to
(13:57) the ground and then over here instead of my outliner let's actually name this one guard spawner instead of Sniper Tower let's just do guard like so instead of one guard let's just say for tutorial sake we want to put in two guards so I'm actually going to hold down that ALT key left click select let's say we have a guard on this side as well so I'm just gonna put two guards in here for right now but let's actually have both of these selected and we already have them set up to what the snipers are but let's set them up for individual guards so let
(14:27) me scroll in here a little bit like so so for guard type maybe you want to have a different skin on here let's say maybe not a ghost but maybe Let's do let's do a grotto something like that and then also for spawn count again maybe we do these one to two so for each spawner it's going to release two guards so we're gonna have four all together the only other thing I want to do right now is come right here under item list coming under index we're going to give them a different gun so let's look for assault I'm just going to give them an assault
(14:59) rifle for both of them which we have right here and then let's scroll down we're going to keep them on the same team so this is going to be team two but remember what I said before if we make them team three then they would actually fight the snipers along with the players in the game as well so we're going to keep them on the same team then for our spawn radius we're going to make it a little bit larger so let me turn on my spawn radius and let's say we want to have them around 18.
(15:24) so now you can see the perimeter that they're going to be guarding is a lot larger now so I can actually turn this back off now play visual effects on the spawn maybe I'll turn it on for these ones so we can see where the guards are going to be at starting health max Health leave everything on in here I think we're going to leave everything else the same except for maybe for accuracy maybe let's put it on high instead of very high and then this is going to be up to you too visibility range this is going to be how far they can see out before
(15:50) they detect you so maybe let's put this down to 50 instead because they aren't snipers maybe their viewport is a little bit low lower so we're going to put this around 50 and then Max Patrol distance maybe we have them Patrol out a little bit larger which would be 18. and now that we have these set let's maybe select one of them let's scroll out a little bit hold down the OK left click let's drag it out we're going to put this one way out to the side maybe because these are going to be the reinforcements so right here instead of
(16:19) my outliner instead of guard spawner guard I'm actually going to name this one re enforcements like so so now we have a guard spawner reinforcements so I'm going to double click on this hold down the right click W just zoom in here a little bit so we're a little bit closer here then maybe let's come back up here instead of guard type Grotto maybe let's make this one something different just so we can see it so let's say we want to have it be this character right here spawn count we have two reinforcements in here for our gun type we could keep
(16:51) it at assault rifle but maybe let's pick a different one so I'm going to type in the salt this one right here just to give a little bit more variety in there looks a little bit different scroll down here keep the team index at two have them all on the same team maybe the spawn right here yes bring this down to five and then we're going to look for Max Patrol distance because we're going to make this one a lot larger because they're coming from a lot further away so maybe 200 because reinforcements maybe you have a building set up here on
(17:19) the side that they're going to be caught in from they come scrolling out so leave this really far away and that's where the reinforcements are going to come into the main fight accuracy maybe since the reinforcements we just put it at moderate and I think that's going to do it for setting up our enemies so we have reinforcements right here we have some guard towers and then we have some regular guards here that are guarding the stronghold now the next thing we're going to set up is the tracker which is going to have the display for the
(17:44) objective of the game and also keep track of all the guards that are eliminated during the gameplay so I'm going to scroll this over a little bit here let me move this over my details panel I'm going to come down to my content drawer make sure I have all selected I'm just going to type in tracker and we want this one right here so we're just going to bring this in scroll it up here a little bit let's move this back because this doesn't have to be near stronghold actually this could just be anywhere on a map so maybe we set up a
(18:13) area for our artist display stuff and stuff that really doesn't matter it doesn't have to be seen so we're just going to have it in here it can rotate it if we want but again this is only going to be for displaying stuff that's on the map there there we go so now we have a Tracker inside of our game here and now we're going to look through some of these attributes and set this up so right here where it says start to track we're going to put it at a value of events and this is going to determine which statistics
(18:39) will be used to track the value there so this is important and then maybe let's say the target value is going to be six we're going to leave the starting value at zero assign on game start we're going to make this one false and also assign when joining in progress we're going to make this one false as well and then right here where it says tracker title this is where we're going to have the objective displayed up so let's say eliminate so that's going to be the tracker title eliminate stronghold guards and then right here under
(19:07) descriptive text let's just put number of guards and then we're going to scroll down look for sharing instead of individual it's going to be a team objective here so these stats are going to be evolved with the entire team and then let's look for winning team which is right here so we're going to come to team index and this is going to be team index number one so team index one that's going to be our players and remember team index 2 that's going to be our guards and our snipers now the next thing we're going
(19:35) to set up is the HUD message devices which will alert us whenever the guards recognize we're in the area and also we'll put up a display whenever they call for reinforcements so coming back down here to my content drawer let's look for I'm going to delete tracker here I'm going to type in HUD message and that should bring up this little item here which I'm just going to drag and drop this into my scene as well double click that's going to bring us in here and we actually want to bring two of them in here so I'm actually going to
(20:02) make sure I have this selected hold down the ALT key click and drag and now we have two devices in here for our head message so I'm going to select this first one here let me actually come through Hub message device I'm just going to name this one HUD message device fall back like so I'm going to come through let's change out some of these attributes in here so make sure you have it selected here and then for your message let's just say guards retreating so guys retrading to the stronghold and then we're going to click
(20:36) on the other one right here our device let's change out the name for this one so it's going to be HUD message device let's say reinforcements and so make sure you have this one selected like so and we're going to put our message in here in which let's say we want to say detected exclamation point so it's going to say message detected income and reinforcements and that's going to actually display up on our screen for us now the next thing we're going to bring up is the item grinder device and what this is going to do is going to allow us
(21:04) to have the player have all the items they need at the start so this could be with guns or weapons to have and even consumables if we want to give them something to heal themselves with so I'm going to come down here to my content drawer let's look for item graner and that's going to bring up this little pot looking thing here so I'm just going to click and drag it into my scene and again it doesn't really matter where it's at inside of our scene here just as long as it's in our scene so make sure I have that selected never here and my
(21:33) outliner let's just name this item grinter players because this is everything that's going to the players and then we're going to come in their hair under a details panel and let's start messing with these attributes so on-grain action clear inventory I'm actually going to put keep all and this is going to allow our players to keep their inventory and where it says Grant I'm going to have all items and these are all the items that I'm going to set for the players that have at the beginning and then give extra ammo because why not and then
(22:03) under item list this is where we're going to give the items to our players so I'm going to select maybe four different items and down here let's start off maybe give them an assault rifle so let's just give them an assault rifle which is going to be index zero this one maybe let's give them a sniper rifle let's do the automatic sniper rifle something like that you could give them anything that you want in here let's look for maybe a SMG and just put a machine gun right there SMG and then maybe something to heal themselves with
(22:37) so I'm just gonna do a bandage something right there so I gave him three weapons and I gave him a bandage there so there's gonna be four items in all and then scrolling down here I'm gonna do enable and start game how about on receiving players I'm gonna do team index one because these are this is going to be the team that's going to be receiving the items Grant condition always Grant on Cycles I'm just gonna have this as true equip Grant items I'm gonna put this on true items to Grant we have four items in there so I'm just
(23:07) going to select four cycle behavior I'm Gonna Leave This as stop so if I scroll down here at the very bottom right here from Grant on game start you definitely want to make sure you have this selected so that the character has all the items and I think I'm going to leave everything else as default now before proceeding on I haven't saved in a while so I'm going to come down here to content drawer hit save all because it's always a good and important to save at all always just in case something crashes so we just set up our players
(23:34) with weapons and hailing devices that they need to get started now we're going to set up a matte indicator so they know exactly where the stronghold is at on their map sit down here under content drawer I'm gonna look for map indicator so in my search bar just type in map in the cater I'm just going to left click and drag this into my scene here like so and as long as it's in here this isn't going to be visible at all we don't need to see it so I'm just going to have this selected maybe we're looking at it but
(24:03) it doesn't really matter because the only thing that matters is the attributes in here so these are going to be the icons that show up on the map there so you can have anything that you want in there so let me type in t underscore UI underscore icon we have a lot of different icons in here so let's say maybe just for a stronghold just for Giggles here maybe we just use this one right here the hamster ball then you want to use the one that says 64.
(24:29) so I'm going to come to the larger one right here let's just type in hamster just to take us there faster and I want to use this one for 128 so for the smaller icon we'll use 64 for the larger icon we're going to use 128 and then for the icon color let's select something maybe like red somewhere around there and for my text I'm just going to name this one stronghold so they know exactly what it is on the map now the last device we're going to add is called an in-game device this is going to alert our players after they finish so whether they were
(24:59) detected undetected or whatever happens at the end of the level this is going to be the message that they receive so coming down to my content drawer let's select this let's look for end game end game device and it's going to be this one right here so I'm just going to click and drag it into my level here again this doesn't matter where it's going to be maybe have it looking at camera here it doesn't really matter as always if we want to have three of these I'll hold down the ALT key left click drag and the same thing again hold down the ALT key
(25:29) left click drag and now I have three of these devices in here so my first one that I have right here I'm actually going to name it in-game device undetected so right here like so instead of my outliner and then I'm going to select this middle one right here and I'm just going to name this one in-game device detect it and then for my last one I'm just going to name this one in-game device fail and that's for if they lost so going back to my in-game device undetected we're gonna mess around with some of these attributes in here it's a
(26:00) winning team that's going to be activating team like so and activating team is going to be any they're already set up for team one here and then for a custom Victory call out let's do stronghold was cleared like so because this is going to be if they were undetected and then right here for end game call out this is going to be cooperative because this is a team sport so that's the only things that we're going to switch there now we're going to go over to detected same thing winning team activating team just going
(26:29) to leave this at any then I could come back here let me actually just copy this and I'm going to paste it into my custom Victory call out instead of undetected I'm just going to put detect it like so maybe even exclamation point there at the end in-game call out Cooperative once again and then leave everything else as is then I'm going to come over here to in-game device fail same thing activating team and then from a custom Victory call out I'm just going to put failed all in capital letters exclamation point like so and then end
(27:03) game call out I'm just going to put as Cooperative as I did for the others and as always come down here to the content drawer come over to save all save selected and we're good to go so now we're currently completed we're setting up other devices in the next part we're going to set up some verses again we're just going to copy and paste it from the document to allow us to bring all this together so I want my tab key back over here I want to bring up my verses tab so I'm going to come up here to verse come down here diverse explore and now I have
(27:33) this back here now I'm realizing that I actually named this wrong it shouldn't be stronghold game manager this one should be for the least position so I'm just going to actually rename this right click rename file and I'm just going to name this one lease position like so and this is going to say when you rename your verse file a module verse devices continue to use the old verse path so I just click OK and then I'm going to have to go back and change some of these out a little bit so let me actually look inside my viewport here
(28:04) I'm going to select this one where it says stronghold leak position select this come over to my details panel I just want to make sure it says stronghold at least position which it does visible in game turned off as it should be and then for my inner and outer radius I should actually set these up right now so for my position I'm just going to actually up this a little bit make it 24 make this one 25 and then let me click on my fallback one which is back here and where it says leash inner radius I'm just going to make this one 700
(28:39) and this one 750. so I'm going to come back down here the content drawer save all save selected and we should be good now so that wasn't too much just had to go back and switch it out and then also set my parameters for the radius now with this selected I'm going to come back over here at the very top where it says stronghold tutorial I'm going to right click add new verse file to project and now for this one I'm going to name this one stronghold underscore game underscore manager is I shouldn't have the first time but we
(29:13) just made good on that so right now under create empty I'm going to left click on this now we see this right here where we have stronghold game manager so you make sure that you have both of these in here and right here where it says stronghold game manager I'm going to double click on it and this should look very familiar to you so we're going to actually put in the versus code the epic game supplied for us so going back to the documentation I'm right here under section three versus adverse scripts to device I'm actually going to
(29:40) select everything in here just scroll through just left click and scroll on your mouse all the way to the bottom here make sure you have everything selected I'm going to right click copy and then side of here I'm just going to delete this little script right there hold down control hit V just paste everything in here come up the file come over to save I'm going to exit this out and then with this still selected we're going to come up here to verse and then right here under build I'm going to build verse code left click on this and now I can
(30:15) exit this out and now if I come under here under my content drawer I'm going to come under creative devices like so and now we should have two selected right here and so I'm going to do this one right here the stronghold underscore game manager it's going to look just like these ones right here so when I bring it in it's going to be another device so I'm just going to scroll up and I'm just going to separate this from the other two because this is what we're going to use to customize all the gameplay it has nothing to do with the
(30:40) strongholds over here so this is another one that's not going to be visible in game so I just have everything right here and this little power here you're not going to see it during the gameplay so over here and inside my details panel let me actually move this over again drag this over and where it says visible in game we're going to start by selecting this off and then let's make sure we have this selected and let's come through and set some of the stuff here inside the attributes so guard's initial spawn right here I'm going to click on this
(31:10) add element and actually let's add two more because we want to have our guards we want to have our snipers and our reinforcements so I'm going to select this one guard one so right here where it says guards initial spawners I'm just going to select this three times and right here I'm going to have my guard one regard to then we're going to have our Sniper Tower let's add another one to Sniper Tower 2 as well and then right here under guards reinforcement spawners I'm going to left click on this and let's just put in our reinforcement ones right
(31:43) here guard spawner reinforcements go ahead left click put that in there and then right here where it says objective tracker I'm going to left click on this I'm going to select the tracker device that we just put in there and then message device for reinforcements I'm going to click this one where it says reinforcements HUD message device reinforcements and then this one for message device fallback again come under here head message device fallback select that one right there in game Victory undetected I'm gonna go to this one in-game
(32:12) undetected so you can kind of see the pattern that's happening right so detected select detect it right there fail game device that one right there as well now this one is going to be how many times you want them to be able to retry before they're able to fail so right now instead of two maybe we just set this to five give them a fighting chance then right here where it says reinforcement lease reference I'm going to left click on this we're going to do the fallback one and then for the reference we're going to do position and
(32:40) then I think that's going to do it for us there so I'm going to come back down here just click save all save selected and we should be good to go at least to test everything out here so let's actually customize this before we move on a little bit so we didn't have these guards going along a path at all and so let me come down here content drawer and type in path and right here where it says AI Patrol path I'm just going to left click and drag this in here and maybe we want to have them patrolling along some steps here so let me come
(33:08) back down here content drawer and type in stairs maybe let's just look for maybe this one right here so these set of stairs right here they said are going to crawl upon these ones right here so let's change this to like 90 degrees then I'm going to select this right here this is going to be the start of our path move it maybe to the bottom of our steps here somewhere around there let me actually move the steps and header the stronghold there we go so right here we're going to have the guards Maybe coming along this path right here so
(33:41) let's have them start right here and then this one right here I'm going to hold down the ALT key left click and drag drag it up top here and now you can see the path that is actually going to be traveled so I'm going to hold down the ALT key drag again you can see they're automatically connecting here hold down the ALT key drag again maybe have them come up the steps like so and maybe let's have a platform for them so let's just do something simple come over here to shapes maybe just lay a cube in here let's make this Cube like by three
(34:16) we can actually just customize it by hitting the scale tool somewhere around here okay and now we can have them moving along this path as well so I'm just holding down the ALT key maybe so that's going to be the patrolling that they're doing right so we have them starting here going here here up the steps along this path and everything and they're just going to collide with the Collision here and everything that's already built in so for a patrol group path I'm just going to leave this at one and then right here I'm going to select
(34:43) my guard here and right here where it says spawn on control group path I'm just going to select one for this one as well and so this group of guards are actually going to walk along this path right here so hopefully everything works out one last time we're just going to save all and then we're just going to test our level here and with our session launch let's actually play this out and just see how everything works hopefully everything is going to court in the plan and what my trusty Xbox controller is going to make it a lot easier to test
(35:09) this out but feel free to push it to your console even maybe I did a tutorial on how to get that going as well so make sure you check that one out but looks like the game's starting let's start playing all right so we're starting off we're actually behind some stuff right now you can see there's the reinforcement guy he's running over to where the rest of the team is let me actually start off with the sniper rifle let me take this sniper out up here he sees me uh maybe I have to fix that but that's the part of
(35:37) gameplay right like you want to go through this is stuff that you're testing here but we actually see oh he's sneaking up from that side he's actually ducking pretty smart there let's take him out there we go so now I'm going to reload behind my obstacle here the other guy just saw me so let's see when he comes around the corner gonna take him out like so hit reload there we still have our sniper up there he's still alerted this guy right here let's take out this reinforcement now the last person that we have to take out would be our sniper
(36:06) so looks like I could come over here bam bam oh he's coming after me but just took him out right there and I just defeated the stronghold so I was detected and you guys can see the bases that we're coming up with here so hopefully yes you see the foundation that's being built here that you guys can make your own cool stronghold levels and make sure you leave me some of your links down below give me some of your code so I could try them out because I'd be happy to try them out maybe even do some gameplay with you guys and just see
(36:35) what you guys come up with here so once again this is the basic Foundation that we're building out to something bigger so hopefully go through the documents because there's a lot more there if you want to add like sound effects and cinematics all that really cool stuff that's really going to amp it up and make it really something memorable for other people in the community go ahead and try out so if you're happy with this tutorial hopefully it helped you out make sure you leave me a comment down below subscribe if you're new and until
(37:00) next time stay fresh keep building and I'll catch you in the next one I'll see you soon take care thank you foreign
